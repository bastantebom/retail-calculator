# Retail Calculator App

This application is a tool that will help to calculate if the amount was eligible for the discount based on the amount to purchase it will also determine the amount of tax to be included in the total amount based on the region/state


## Project architecture

The project was written using React + Typescript and running into a Vite development environment. We also added a tailwind for styling purposes so it would be easier for us to add styles.

## How to run

In the root directory (retail-calculator):
```yarn dev``` or ```npm run dev```
